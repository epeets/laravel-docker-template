# LARAVEL ON DOCKER TEMPLATE

This is a basic template to spin up Laravel on docker.

This is mostly not my own work but the work of dev.to linked below:

https://dev.to/aschmelyun/the-beauty-of-docker-for-local-laravel-development-13c0

I just wanted it in an easy git clone version. Please follow the article to get your dev site going after you clone this repo.

## HOW TO

If you clone this, all you need to do is create your own src folder and then install Laravel inside that src folder. I tend to let Laravel composer install create the src folder for me by using the following command:

"laravel new src"

but this assumes you have Laravel already setup on your command line and that you actually want to use "src" as your primary folder.

If you need help installing Laravel please follow the link below:

If you need any assistance beyond what the dev.to article linked above provides please let me know by opening a git issue!
